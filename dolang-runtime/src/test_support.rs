/// unlike a symbol interned via a `Strand` later) or a fixture type with
/// `Builder::register_type` — and then enter the VM themselves, typically via

/// calling thread. Values a test needs to hold onto — across a call that might allocate
/// or yield — belong in one of these slots, never in a bare, unrooted Rust local: use
/// `Slot::reborrow` to hand a slot to something that wants to fill it (e.g. as an `out`

/// could allocate or yield — this keeps the one `unsafe` `Args` construction it takes to
/// build a call-argument list contained here instead of scattered across test bodies.

/// Takes `slots` by exclusive reference, for the same lifetime as the returned `Args`,
