# LSP Guide

The `dolang-lsp` crate provides a Language Server Protocol server for Do,
enabling IDE features in any LSP-compatible editor.

## Supported Features

- **Semantic tokens**: Syntax highlighting based on the compiler's
  understanding of the code (not just regex patterns). Tokens are marked with
  the `declaration`/`definition` modifiers where a name is introduced, the
  `defaultLibrary` modifier for prelude bindings, and the `static` modifier for
  a field a `#[class]` or `#[static]` decorator scopes to its class
- **Diagnostics**: Compile-time errors and warnings reported in real time
- **Go to definition**: Jump to the definition of variables and functions
- **Document symbols**: The outline of a file -- classes, functions, methods,
  fields, bindings and imports, nested under whatever declares them
- **Find references and highlight**: Every use of the name under the cursor,
  for the "find all references" command and for highlighting occurrences as
  the cursor moves

Both references and go-to-definition are limited to the current file, and
resolve names the compiler resolves: a field access such as `self.count` is
dynamic, so only the field's declaration is reported.

## Running the LSP

Build `dolang-lsp` alongside `dolang` and `dolang-vfs` for a complete source
installation:

```bash
cargo build --release --bin dolang --bin dolang-lsp --bin dolang-vfs
```

Configure your editor to use `dolang-lsp` as the language server for `.dol`
files.

The repository's VS Code extension starts `dolang-lsp` automatically.

## Configuration with `.dolang-lsp.toml`

The LSP searches upward from each file's directory for a configuration file
named `.dolang-lsp.toml`. This file contains static settings.

### Prelude Override

The primary use of the config file is to specify the prelude -- the set of
imports that the LSP assumes are available in scope. This tells the LSP what
names exist so it can provide accurate diagnostics and completions.

The file may contain a `prelude` table describing what to import.

```
# .dolang-lsp.toml
[prelude]
my_module = true
```

Supported forms:

```toml
[prelude]
sys = true
regression = ["assert", "log"]

[prelude.shell]
echo = true
env = true

[prelude.proc]
mod = true
sub = true
run = true
```

### Default Prelude

When no `.dolang-lsp.toml` is found, the LSP defaults to the `dolang`
prelude, which also includes the core language prelude.

### When to Use This

The config file is primarily useful for **non-`dolang` projects** -- for
example, when Do is embedded in a Rust application with custom native
functions. It tells the LSP what names your embedding provides so diagnostics
don't report false "unbound variable" errors.

For `dolang` projects, the default prelude is correct and no
configuration file is needed.
