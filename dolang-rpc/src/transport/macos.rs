//! Closes the SCM_RIGHTS `FD_CLOEXEC` race described in issue #384.
//!
//! macOS's `recvmsg` has no `MSG_CMSG_CLOEXEC` equivalent, so `unix::recv_once`
//! sets close-on-exec on each received descriptor after the fact via
//! `ioctl(FIOCLEX)`. Between `recvmsg` returning and that `ioctl` completing,
//! a concurrent `fork()` or `posix_spawn`/`posix_spawnp` elsewhere in the
//! process (including code we don't control) can inherit the descriptor.
//! `pthread_atfork` alone doesn't cover this: it never fires for
//! `posix_spawn`-based spawns, which is the path `std::process::Command`
//! takes on macOS whenever it can. So this module serializes descriptor
//! receipt against every spawn in the process:
//!
//! - [`ReadGuard`] is held by `recv_once` across `recvmsg` and the `FIOCLEX`
//!   loop (read mode; concurrent receives don't conflict with each other).
//! - `pthread_atfork` takes the write lock in `prepare` and releases it in
//!   both `parent` and `child`, covering explicit `fork()`.
//! - `posix_spawn`/`posix_spawnp` are interposed process-wide via
//!   `DYLD_INTERPOSE`, taking the write lock around the real call, covering
//!   `Command::spawn()` and any other spawn anywhere in the process.
